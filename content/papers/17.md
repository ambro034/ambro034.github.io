##### Abstract

The paper develops a new method for detecting US recessions in real time. The method combines recession classifiers selected from the anticipation-precision frontier, improving upon traditional approaches like the Sahm rule. The Sahm rule and similar threshold-based methods rely on simple but arbitrary triggers. The proposed method systematically constructs and evaluates millions of recession classifiers, constructed  by combining unemployment and vacancy data to reduce detection noise. The classifiers are trained to avoid both false negatives (missed recessions) and false positives (nonexistent recessions). By selecting classifiers that lie on the anticipation-precision frontier, the method optimizes early detection without sacrificing precision. Using classifiers trained on 1929–2021, I find that the probability that the US is in recession in February 2025 is 71%. Backtesting confirms that the new method detects recessions in a timely manner and with great reliability, providing a robust tool for policymakers.
